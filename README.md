# Project SkyWatch

### About
Skywatch is a website where you'll be able to check flight status and the weather at your destination.

### Development Process
* HTML
* Be able to get flight's status via flight number
  * At first we had troubles with the initial API we chose so we had to find a new one that provided status and gets flight info via flight number   
* Provide weather data 
  * Used a geolocation API to get the city of the arrival airport then give the user weather data from that
* CSS Framework
  * Bulma CSS Framework 


### Project Requirements
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
